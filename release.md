## Don't drink and drive! 
But, why not travel by train to see (every) whisky distillery in Scotland?

During my research stay in Edinburgh with @MaxParzen I have developed a dashboard using the opportunities provided by #opendata and #opensouce.


If you want to visit all 136 distilleries, you need to walk 2603 km: the equivalent of **62 marathons**.
The amount of whisky consumed assuming 3 x 35 ml per distillery is: **14.39 litres of whisky**.

Enjoy!
